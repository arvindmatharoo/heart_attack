# 💓 Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the risk of a heart attack using machine learning based on real-world clinical data provided by my academic mentor. It demonstrates how logistic regression can be effectively applied in healthcare scenarios to detect early signs of cardiovascular risk.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Provided by Professor (not publicly available)
- **Features**: 13 clinical health indicators (e.g., age, cholesterol, chest pain type, max heart rate)
- **Target**: `output` — binary (0: No Heart Attack, 1: At Risk)

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart attack
- Focus on achieving high precision to minimize false alarms
- Use interpretable models for potential real-world application

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Preprocessing:
  - Cleaned data, handled missing values (if any)
  - Encoded categorical variables
  - Standardized features
- Modeling:
  - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
  - Performed **hyperparameter tuning** with `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluation:
  - **Accuracy**: 0.907
  - **Precision**: 0.888
  - Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results

- High-performing and interpretable model
- Suitable for early diagnosis scenarios where false positives must be minimized
- Shows strong potential for real-world clinical applications with further validation
